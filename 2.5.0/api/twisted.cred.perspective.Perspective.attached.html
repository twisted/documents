    <div><p>Called when a remote reference is 'attached' to me.</p>
<p>After being authorized, a remote actor can attach to me through its 
identity. This call will be made when that happens, and the return value 
of this method will be used as the _actual_ perspective to which I am 
attached.</p>
Note that the symmetric call, detached, will be made on whatever this 
method returns, _not_ on me. Therefore, by default I return 'self'.
