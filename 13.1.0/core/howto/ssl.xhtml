    <h1>Using SSL in Twisted</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>This document describes how to use SSL in Twisted servers and clients. It
    assumes that you know what SSL is, what some of the major reasons to use it
    are, and how to generate your own SSL certificates, in particular self-signed
    certificates. It also assumes that you are comfortable with creating TCP
    servers and clients as described in the <a href="servers.xhtml">server howto
    </a> and <a href="clients.xhtml">client howto</a>. After reading this
    document you should be able to create servers and clients that can use SSL to
    encrypt their connections, switch from using an unencrypted channel to an
    encrypted one mid-connection, and require client authentication.</p>

    <p>Using SSL in Twisted requires that you have
    <a href="http://launchpad.net/pyopenssl">pyOpenSSL</a> installed. A quick test to
    verify that you do is to run <code>from OpenSSL import SSL</code> at a
    python prompt and not get an error.</p>

    <p>
      Twisted provides SSL support as a transport - that is, as an alternative
      to TCP.  When using SSL, use of the TCP APIs you're already familiar
      with, <code>TCP4ClientEndpoint</code> and <code>TCP4ServerEndpoint</code> -
      or <code>reactor.listenTCP</code> and <code>reactor.connectTCP</code> -
      is replaced by use of parallel SSL APIs.  To create an SSL server, use
      <code class="API" base="twisted.internet.endpoints">SSL4ServerEndpoint</code> or
      <code class="API" base="twisted.internet.interfaces.IReactorSSL">listenSSL</code>.
      To create an SSL client, use
      <code class="API" base="twisted.internet.endpoints">SSL4ClientEndpoint</code> or
      <code class="API" base="twisted.internet.interfaces.IReactorSSL">connectSSL</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      SSL connections require SSL contexts. As with protocols, these context
      objects are created by factories - so that each connection can be given a
      unique context, if necessary.  The context factories typically also keep
      state which is necessary to properly configure an SSL context object for
      its desired use - for example, private key or certificate data.  The
      context factory is passed as a mandatory argument to any and all of the
      SSL APIs mentioned in the previous
      paragraph.  <code class="API">twisted.internet.ssl.CertificateOptions</code>
      is one commonly useful context factory for both clients and
      servers.  <code class="API">twisted.internet.ssl.PrivateCertificate.options</code>
      is a convenient way to create a <code>CertificateOptions</code> instance
      configured to use a particular key and certificate.
    </p>

    <p>Those are the big immediate differences between TCP and SSL connections,
    so let's look at an example. In it and all subsequent examples it is assumed
    that keys and certificates for the server, certificate authority, and client
    should they exist live in a <i>keys/</i> subdirectory of the directory
    containing the example code, and that the certificates are self-signed.</p>

    <h2>SSL echo server and client without client authentication</h2>

    <p>Authentication and encryption are two separate parts of the SSL protocol.
    The server almost always needs a key and certificate to authenticate itself
    to the client but is usually configured to allow encrypted connections with
    unauthenticated clients who don't have certificates. This common case is
    demonstrated first by adding SSL support to the echo client and server in
    the <a href="../examples/index.html">core examples</a>.</p>

    <h3>SSL echo server</h3>

    <!-- Don't diverge this from doc/core/examples/echoserv_ssl.py -->
    <pre class="python">
if __name__ == '__main__':
    import echoserv_ssl
    raise SystemExit(echoserv_ssl.main())

import sys

from twisted.internet import reactor
from twisted.internet.protocol import Factory
from twisted.internet import ssl, reactor
from twisted.python import log

import echoserv

def main():
    with open('server.pem') as keyAndCert:
        cert = ssl.PrivateCertificate.loadPEM(keyAndCert.read())

    log.startLogging(sys.stdout)
    factory = Factory()
    factory.protocol = echoserv.Echo
    reactor.listenSSL(8000, factory, cert.options())
    reactor.run()
</pre>

    <h3>SSL echo client</h3>

    <!-- Don't diverge this from doc/core/examples/echoclient_ssl.py -->
    <pre class="python">
if __name__ == '__main__':
    import echoclient_ssl
    raise SystemExit(echoclient_ssl.main())

import sys

from twisted.internet.protocol import ClientFactory
from twisted.protocols.basic import LineReceiver
from twisted.internet import ssl, reactor


class EchoClient(LineReceiver):
    end="Bye-bye!"
    def connectionMade(self):
        self.sendLine("Hello, world!")
        self.sendLine("What a fine day it is.")
        self.sendLine(self.end)

    def connectionLost(self, reason):
        print 'connection lost (protocol)'

    def lineReceived(self, line):
        print "receive:", line
        if line==self.end:
            self.transport.loseConnection()

class EchoClientFactory(ClientFactory):
    protocol = EchoClient

    def clientConnectionFailed(self, connector, reason):
        print 'connection failed:', reason.getErrorMessage()
        reactor.stop()

    def clientConnectionLost(self, connector, reason):
        print 'connection lost:', reason.getErrorMessage()
        reactor.stop()

def main():
    factory = EchoClientFactory()
    reactor.connectSSL('localhost', 8000, factory, ssl.CertificateOptions())
    reactor.run()
</pre>

    <p>
      Notice how all of the protocol code from the TCP version of the echo
      client and server examples is the same (imported or repeated) in these SSL
      versions - only the reactor method used to initiate a network action is
      different.
    </p>

    <p>
      One part of the SSL connection contexts control is which version of the
      SSL protocol will be used.  This is often called the context's "method".
      By default, <code>CertificateOptions</code> creates contexts which will
      select the TLSv1 protocol.  <code>CertificateOptions</code> also supports
      the older SSLv3 protocol (which may be required interoperate with an
      existing service or piece of software), just
      pass <code>OpenSSL.SSL.SSLv3_METHOD</code> to its
      initializer: <code>CertificateOptions(..., method=SSLv3_METHOD)</code>.
      <code>SSLv23_METHOD</code> is also supported (to enable either SSLv3 or
      TLSv1 based on negotiation).  SSLv2 is explicitly not supported.
    </p>

    <h2>Using startTLS</h2>

    <p>If you want to switch from unencrypted to encrypted traffic
    mid-connection, you'll need to turn on SSL with <code class="API"
    base="twisted.internet.interfaces.ITLSTransport">startTLS</code> on both
    ends of the connection at the same time via some agreed-upon signal like the
    reception of a particular message. You can readily verify the switch to an
    encrypted channel by examining the packet payloads with a tool like
    <a href="http://www.wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a>.</p>

    <h3>startTLS server</h3>

    <pre class="python">
from twisted.internet import reactor, ssl
from twisted.internet.protocol import ServerFactory
from twisted.protocols.basic import LineReceiver

class TLSServer(LineReceiver):
    def lineReceived(self, line):
        print "received: " + line

        if line == "STARTTLS":
            print "-- Switching to TLS"
            self.sendLine('READY')

            self.transport.startTLS(self.factory.contextFactory)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    with open("keys/server.key") as keyFile:
        with open("keys/server.crt") as certFile:
            cert = PrivateCertificate.loadPEM(
                keyFile.read() + certFile.read())

    factory = ServerFactory()
    factory.protocol = TLSServer
    factory.contextFactory = cert.options()
    reactor.listenTCP(8000, factory)
    reactor.run()
    </pre>

    <h3>startTLS client</h3>

    <pre class="python">
from twisted.internet import reactor, ssl
from twisted.internet.protocol import ClientFactory
from twisted.protocols.basic import LineReceiver

class TLSClient(LineReceiver):
    pretext = [
        "first line",
        "last thing before TLS starts",
        "STARTTLS"]

    posttext = [
        "first thing after TLS started",
        "last thing ever"]

    def connectionMade(self):
        for l in self.pretext:
            self.sendLine(l)

    def lineReceived(self, line):
        print "received: " + line
        if line == "READY":
            self.transport.startTLS(ssl.CertificateOptions())
            for l in self.posttext:
                self.sendLine(l)
            self.transport.loseConnection()

class TLSClientFactory(ClientFactory):
    protocol = TLSClient

    def clientConnectionFailed(self, connector, reason):
        print "connection failed: ", reason.getErrorMessage()
        reactor.stop()

    def clientConnectionLost(self, connector, reason):
        print "connection lost: ", reason.getErrorMessage()
        reactor.stop()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    factory = TLSClientFactory()
    reactor.connectTCP('localhost', 8000, factory)
    reactor.run()
    </pre>

    <p><code>startTLS</code> is a transport method that gets passed a context
    factory.  It is invoked at an agreed-upon time in the data reception method
    of the client and server protocols. The server
    uses <code>PrivateCertificate.options</code> to create a context factory
    which will use a particular certificate and private key (a common
    requirement for SSL servers).  The client creates an
    uncustomized <code>CertificateOptions</code> which is all that's necessary
    for an SSL client to interact with an SSL server, although it is missing
    some verification settings necessary to ensure correct authentication of the
    server and confidentiality of data exchanged.</p>

    <h2>Client authentication</h2>

    <p>Server and client-side changes to require client authentication fall
    largely under the dominion of pyOpenSSL, but few examples seem to exist on
    the web so for completeness a sample server and client are provided here.</p>

    <h3>Client-authenticating server</h3>

    <pre class="python">
from twisted.internet import ssl, reactor
from twisted.internet.protocol import Factory, Protocol

class Echo(Protocol):
    def dataReceived(self, data):
        self.transport.write(data)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    factory = Factory()
    factory.protocol = Echo

    with open("keys/ca.pem") as certAuthCertFile:
        certAuthCert = ssl.Certificate.loadPEM(certAuthCertFile.read())

    with open("keys/server.key") as keyFile:
        with open("keys/server.crt") as certFile:
            serverCert = ssl.PrivateCertificate.loadPEM(
                keyFile.read() + certFile.read())

    contextFactory = serverCert.options(certAuthCert)

    reactor.listenSSL(8000, factory, contextFactory)
    reactor.run()
    </pre>

    <p>
      When one or more certificates are passed
      to <code>PrivateCertificate.options</code>, the resulting context factory
      will use those certificates as trusted authorities and require that the
      peer present a certificate with a valid chain terminating in one of those
      authorities.
    </p>

    <h3>Client with certificates</h3>

    <pre class="python">
from twisted.internet import ssl, reactor
from twisted.internet.protocol import ClientFactory, Protocol

class EchoClient(Protocol):
    def connectionMade(self):
        print "hello, world"
        self.transport.write("hello, world!")

    def dataReceived(self, data):
        print "Server said:", data
        self.transport.loseConnection()


class EchoClientFactory(ClientFactory):
    protocol = EchoClient

    def clientConnectionFailed(self, connector, reason):
        print "Connection failed - goodbye!"
        reactor.stop()

    def clientConnectionLost(self, connector, reason):
        print "Connection lost - goodbye!"
        reactor.stop()


if __name__ == '__main__':
    with open("keys/server.key") as keyFile:
        with open("keys/server.crt") as certFile:
            clientCert = ssl.PrivateCertificate.loadPEM(
                keyFile.read() + certFile.read())

    ctx = clientCert.options()
    factory = EchoClientFactory()
    reactor.connectSSL('localhost', 8000, factory, ctx)
    reactor.run()
    </pre>

    <p>
      Notice this client code does not pass any certificate authority
      certificates to <code>PrivateCertificate.options</code>.  This means that
      it will not validate the server's certificate, it will only present its
      certificate to the server for validation.
    </p>

    <h2>Other facilities</h2>

    <p><code class="API">twisted.protocols.amp</code> supports encrypted
    connections and exposes a <code>startTLS</code> method one can use or
    subclass. <code class="API">twisted.web</code> has built-in SSL support in
    its <code class="API" base="twisted.web">client</code>, <code class="API"
    base="twisted.web">http</code>, and <code class="API"
    base="twisted.web">xmlrpc</code> modules.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>After reading through this tutorial, you should be able to: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use <code>listenSSL</code> and <code>connectSSL</code> to create servers and clients that use
      SSL</li>
      <li>Use <code>startTLS</code> to switch a channel from being unencrypted to using SSL
      mid-connection</li>
      <li>Add server and client support for client authentication</li>
    </ul>
