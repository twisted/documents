</td></tr><tr><td></td><td class="fieldArg">mind</td><td>an object which implements a client-side interface for your particular 
realm. In many cases, this may be None, so if the word 'mind' confuses 
you, just ignore it.
</td></tr><tr><td></td><td class="fieldArg">interfaces</td><td>list of interfaces for the perspective that the mind wishes to attach 
to. Usually, this will be only one interface, for example IMailAccount. 
For highly dynamic protocols, however, this may be a list like 
(IMailAccount, IUserChooser, IServiceInfo). To expand: if we are speaking 
to the system over IMAP, any information that will be relayed to the user 
MUST be returned as an IMailAccount implementor; IMAP clients would not 
be able to understand anything else. Any information about unusual status 
would have to be relayed as a single mail message in an otherwise-empty 
mailbox. However, in a web-based mail system, or a PB-based client, the 
``mind'' object inside the web server (implemented with a dynamic 
page-viewing mechanism such as woven) or on the user's client program may 
be intelligent enough to respond to several ``server''-side 
interfaces.
</td></tr><tr class="fieldStart"><td class="fieldName">Returns</td><td colspan="2">A deferred which will fire a tuple of (interface, avatarAspect, 
logout). The interface will be one of the interfaces passed in the 
'interfaces' argument. The 'avatarAspect' will implement that interface. 
The 'logout' object is a callable which will detach the mind from the 
avatar. It must be called when the user has conceptually disconnected 
from the service. Although in some cases this will not be in 
connectionLost (such as in a web-based session), it will always be at the 
end of a user's interactive session.
