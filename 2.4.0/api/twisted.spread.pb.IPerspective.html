    <div><p>per*spec*tive, n. : The relationship of aspects of a subject to each 
other and to a whole: 'a perspective of history'; 'a need to view the 
problem in the proper perspective'.</p>
<p>This is a Perspective Broker-specific wrapper for an avatar. That is 
to say, a PB-published view on to the business logic for the system's 
concept of a 'user'.</p>
The concept of attached/detached is no longer implemented by the 
framework. The realm is expected to implement such semantics if 
needed.
