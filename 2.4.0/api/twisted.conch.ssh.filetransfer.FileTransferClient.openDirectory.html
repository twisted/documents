<p>path is the directory to open.</p>
<p>This method returns a Deferred that is called back with an iterable 
object that has a close() method,</p>
<p>The close() method is called when the client is finished reading from 
the directory. At this point, the iterable will no longer be used.</p>
<p>The iterable returns triples of the form (filename, longname, attrs) 
or a Deferred that returns the same. The sequence must support 
__getitem__, but otherwise may be any 'sequence-like' object.</p>
<p>filename is the name of the file relative to the directory. logname is 
an expanded format of the filename. The recommended format is: -rwxr-xr-x
