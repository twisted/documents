    <div><p>Spawn an operating-system process.</p>
<p>This is where the hard work of disconnecting all currently open files 
/ forking / executing the new process happens. (This is executed 
automatically when a Process is instantiated.)</p>
This will also run the subprocess as a given user ID and group ID, if 
specified. (Implementation Note: this doesn't support all the arcane 
nuances of setXXuid on UNIX: it will assume that either your effective or 
real UID is 0.)
<table class="fieldTable"><tr class="fieldStart"><td class="fieldName">Parameters</td><td class="fieldArg">childFDs</td><td><p>a dictionary mapping fd_in_child to current_fd_in_parent/'r'/'w'.</p>
<p>If the value is a number, it specifies one of the parent's fds that 
will be remapped to the child's fd. This is useful for things like inetd 
and shell-like file redirection.</p>
<p>If it is the string 'r', a pipe will be created and attached to the 
child at that fd number, and the parent will be able to read from the 
pipe. This is useful for the child's stdout and stderr.</p>
<p>If it is the string 'w', a pipe will be created and attached, and the 
parent will be able to write into that pipe. This is useful for the 
child's stdin.</p>
If childFDs is not passed, the default behaviour is to use a mapping 
that opens the usual stdin/stdout/stderr pipes.
