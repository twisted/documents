    <div><p>Create or retrieve an adapter for the given interface.</p>
<p>If such an adapter has already been created, retrieve it from the 
cache that this instance keeps of all its adapters. Adapters created 
through this mechanism may safely store system-specific state.</p>
<p>If you want to register an adapter that will be created through 
getComponent, but you don't require (or don't want) your adapter to be 
cached and kept alive for the lifetime of this Componentized object, set 
the attribute 'temporaryAdapter' to True on your adapter class.</p>
If you want to automatically register an adapter for all appropriate 
interfaces (with addComponent), set the attribute 'multiComponent' to 
True on your adapter class.
