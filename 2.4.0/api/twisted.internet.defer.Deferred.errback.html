    <div><p>Run all error callbacks that have been added to this Deferred.</p>
<p>Each callback will have its result passed as the first argument to the 
next; this way, the callbacks act as a 'processing chain'. Also, if the 
error-callback returns a non-Failure or doesn't raise an Exception, 
processing will continue on the *success*-callback chain.</p>
<p>If the argument that's passed to me is not a failure.Failure instance, 
it will be embedded in one. If no argument is passed, a failure.Failure 
instance will be created based on the current traceback stack.</p>
Passing a string as `fail' is deprecated, and will be punished with a 
warning message.
