    <div><p>Called when a connection is made.</p>
This may be considered the initializer of the protocol, because it is 
called when the connection is completed. For clients, this is called once 
the connection to the server has been established; for servers, this is 
called after an accept() call stops blocking and a socket has been 
received. If you need to send any greeting or initial message, do it 
here.
