    <div><p>Turn a nested list structure into an s-exp-like string.</p>
<p>Strings in <code>items</code> will be sent as literals if they contain 
CR or LF, otherwise they will be quoted. References to None in 
<code>items</code> will be translated to the atom NIL. Objects with a 
'read' attribute will have it called on them with no arguments and the 
returned string will be inserted into the output as a literal. Integers 
will be converted to strings and inserted into the output unquoted. 
Instances of <code>DontQuoteMe</code> will be converted to strings and 
inserted into the output unquoted.</p>
This function used to be much nicer, and only quote things that really 
needed to be quoted (and <code>DontQuoteMe</code> did not exist), 
however, many broken IMAP4 clients were unable to deal with this level of 
sophistication, forcing the current behavior to be adopted for practical 
reasons.
