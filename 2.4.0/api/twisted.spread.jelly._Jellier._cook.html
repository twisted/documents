<p>backreference an object.</p>
<p>Notes on this method for the hapless future maintainer: If I've 
already gone through the prepare/preserve cycle on the specified object 
(it is being referenced after the serializer is &quot;done with&quot; it, 
e.g. this reference is NOT circular), the copy-in-place of aList is 
relevant, since the list being modified is the actual, pre-existing jelly 
expression that was returned for that object. If not, it's technically 
superfluous, since the value in self.preserved didn't need to be set, but 
the invariant that self.preserved[id(object)] is a list is convenient 
because that means we don't have to test and create it or not create it 
here, creating fewer code-paths. that's why self.preserved is always set 
to a list.</p>
Sorry that this code is so hard to follow, but Python objects are 
tricky to persist correctly. -glyph
