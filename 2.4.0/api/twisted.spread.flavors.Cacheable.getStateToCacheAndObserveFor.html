locally.</p>
This is similiar to getStateToCopyFor, but it additionally passes in a 
reference to the client-side RemoteCache instance that will be created 
when it is unserialized. This allows Cacheable instances to keep their 
RemoteCaches up to date when they change, such that no changes can occur 
between the point at which the state is initially copied and the client 
receives it that are not propogated.
