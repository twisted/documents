    <div><p>Try to reap a process (without blocking) via waitpid.</p>
<p>This is called when sigchild is caught or a Process object loses its 
&quot;connection&quot; (stdout is closed) This ought to result in reaping 
all zombie processes, since it will be called twice as often as it needs 
to be.</p>
(Unfortunately, this is a slightly experimental approach, since UNIX 
has no way to be really sure that your process is going to go away w/o 
blocking. I don't want to block.)
