Normally you will want to use 'attached', as described in <a 
href="twisted.cred.perspective.Perspective.html">twisted.cred.perspective.Perspective</a>.attached; 
however, this method serves the same purpose, and in some circumstances, 
you are sure that the protocol that objects will be attaching to your 
Perspective with is Perspective Broker, and in that case you may wish to 
get the Broker object they are connecting with, for example, to determine 
what host they are connecting from. Bear in mind that when overriding 
this method, other, non-PB protocols will not notify you of being 
attached or detached.
