    <div><p>Push a line to the interpreter.</p>
The line should not have a trailing newline; it may have internal 
newlines. The line is appended to a buffer and the interpreter's 
runsource() method is called with the concatenated contents of the buffer 
as source. If this indicates that the command was executed or invalid, 
the buffer is reset; otherwise, the command is incomplete, and the buffer 
is left as it was after the line was appended. The return value is 1 if 
more input is required, 0 if the line was dealt with in some way (this is 
the same as runsource()).
