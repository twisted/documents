      Indicates what state this <a href="twisted.web._newclient.HTTP11ClientProtocol.html"><code>HTTP11ClientProtocol</code></a>
instance is in with respect to transmission of a request and reception of a
response.  This may be one of the following strings:
<ul>
  <li>
    QUIESCENT: This is the state <a href="twisted.web._newclient.HTTP11ClientProtocol.html"><code>HTTP11ClientProtocol</code></a>
    instances start in.  Nothing is happening: no request is being sent and
    no response is being received or expected.
  </li>
  <li>
    TRANSMITTING: When a request is made (via <a href="twisted.web._newclient.HTTP11ClientProtocol.html#request"><code>request</code></a>),
    the instance moves to this state.  <a href="twisted.web._newclient.Request.html#writeTo"><code>Request.writeTo</code></a>
    has been used to start to send a request but it has not yet finished.
  </li>
  <li>
    TRANSMITTING_AFTER_RECEIVING_RESPONSE: The server has returned a 
    complete response but the request has not yet been fully sent yet.  The
    instance will remain in this state until the request is fully sent.
  </li>
  <li>
    GENERATION_FAILED: There was an error while the request.  The request 
    was not fully sent to the network.
  </li>
  <li>
    WAITING: The request was fully sent to the network.  The instance is 
    now waiting for the response to be fully received.
  </li>
  <li>
    ABORTING: Application code has requested that the HTTP connection be 
    aborted.
  </li>
  <li>
    CONNECTION_LOST: The connection has been lost.
  </li>
</ul> (type: <code>str</code>)
