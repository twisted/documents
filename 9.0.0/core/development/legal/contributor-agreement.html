  </li>
  <li><h3>Treatment of Account<a name="auto2"/></h3>

  Committer will not allow anyone other than the Committer to use the
  twistedmatrix.com username or login to access a repository or other
  twistedmatrix.com systems.  Should Committer become aware of any such use,
  Committer will immediately notify a Twisted Matrix Administrator in the
  manner specified at the twistedmatrix.com website's Committer's
  instructions page.  Until such notice is received, Committer will be presumed
  to have taken all actions made through Committer's account.  Matthew
  W. Lefkowitz will have complete control and discretion over capabilities
  assigned to Committer's account, and may disable Committer's account for any
  reason at any time.  Committer's name and account will be visible worldwide
  via the Internet.
  </li>

  <li><h3>Copyright Holders of Modules and Repositories<a name="auto3"/></h3>

  <p>Each repository on the twistedmatrix.com source control server, located at
  http://svn.twistedmatrix.com/, has a separate primary copyright
  holder. Copyright Holder will clearly mark files within that module with a
  copyright notice stating their name.</p>

  <p>The License under which the Module is made available to the public will be
  stated in a file at the top level of the module named LICENSE, or clearly
  visible under a similar name.</p>

  <p>Any repositories not so marked on twistedmatrix.com servers and
  other equipment are understood to be copyrighted material with all rights
  reserved.</p>

  </li>

  <li><h3>Legal Effect of Contribution.<a name="auto4"/></h3>

  Upon committing a change or new work to a twistedmatrix.com Module (a
  &quot;Contribution&quot;), you agree to assign, and hereby do assign, a one-half
  interest of all right, title and interest in and to copyright and other
  intellectual property rights with respect to your new and original portions
  of the Contribution to the Primary Copyright Holder for that Module.  You and
  the Copyright Holder each agree that the other shall be free to exercise any
  and all exclusive rights in and to the Contribution, without accounting to
  one another, including without limitation, the right to license the
  Contribution to others under the License specified by that Module.  This
  agreement shall run with title to the Contribution.  The Copyright Holder
  does not convey to you any right, title or interest in or to the Module or
  such portions of the Contribution that were taken from the Module.  Your
  transmission of authentication credentials, including but not limited to a
  password or SSH key, to the twistedmatrix.com server constitutes your
  authentication of intent to contribute and your assignment of the work in
  accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.
  </li>

  <li><h3>Representations, Warranty, and Indemnification.<a name="auto5"/></h3>

  Committer represents and warrants that the Committed Code does not violate
  the rights of any person or entity, and that the Committer has legal
  authority to enter into this Agreement and legal authority over Contributed
  Code.  All parties with potential claim over Committer's copyright in the
  context of contributions to twistedmatrix.com, including but not limited to
  their employer, must be notified and co-sign this agreement to warrant that
  Committer has such legal authority.  Further, Committer indemnifies all other
  users of twistedmatrix.com against violations.
