    <div><p>deferredGenerator and waitForDeferred help you write Deferred-using code
that looks like a regular sequential function. If your code has a minimum 
requirement of Python 2.5, consider the use of <a 
href="twisted.internet.defer.html#inlineCallbacks"><code>inlineCallbacks</code></a>
instead, which can accomplish the same thing in a more concise manner.</p>
There are two important functions involved: waitForDeferred, and 
deferredGenerator.  They are used together, like this:
<pre class="literalblock">
   def thingummy():
       thing = waitForDeferred(makeSomeRequestResultingInDeferred())
       yield thing
       thing = thing.getResult()
       print thing #the result! hoorj!
   thingummy = deferredGenerator(thingummy)
</pre>
<p>waitForDeferred returns something that you should immediately yield; 
when your generator is resumed, calling thing.getResult() will either give 
you the result of the Deferred if it was a success, or raise an exception 
if it was a failure.  Calling <code>getResult</code> is <b>absolutely 
mandatory</b>.  If you do not call it, <i>your program will not 
work</i>.</p>
<p>deferredGenerator takes one of these waitForDeferred-using generator 
functions and converts it into a function that returns a Deferred. The 
result of the Deferred will be the last value that your generator yielded 
unless the last value is a waitForDeferred instance, in which case the 
result will be <code>None</code>.  If the function raises an unhandled 
exception, the Deferred will errback instead.  Remember that 'return 
result' won't work; use 'yield result; return' in place of that.</p>
<p>Note that not yielding anything from your generator will make the 
Deferred result in None. Yielding a Deferred from your generator is also an
error condition; always yield waitForDeferred(d) instead.</p>
The Deferred returned from your deferred generator may also errback if 
your generator raised an exception.  For example:
<pre class="literalblock">
   def thingummy():
       thing = waitForDeferred(makeSomeRequestResultingInDeferred())
       yield thing
       thing = thing.getResult()
       if thing == 'I love Twisted':
           # will become the result of the Deferred
           yield 'TWISTED IS GREAT!'
           return
       else:
           # will trigger an errback
           raise Exception('DESTROY ALL LIFE')
   thingummy = deferredGenerator(thingummy)
</pre>
Put succinctly, these functions connect deferred-using code with this 
'fake blocking' style in both directions: waitForDeferred converts from a 
Deferred to the 'blocking' style, and deferredGenerator converts from the 
'blocking' style to a Deferred.
