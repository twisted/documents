    <div><p>The only way a write pipe can become &quot;readable&quot; is at EOF, 
because the child has closed it, and we're using a reactor which doesn't 
distinguish between readable and closed (such as the select reactor).</p>
<p>Except that's not true on linux &lt; 2.6.11. It has the following 
characteristics: write pipe is completely empty =&gt; POLLOUT (writable in 
select), write pipe is not completely empty =&gt; POLLIN (readable in 
select), write pipe's reader closed =&gt; POLLIN|POLLERR (readable and 
writable in select)</p>
<p>That's what this funky code is for. If linux was not broken, this 
function could be simply &quot;return CONNECTION_LOST&quot;.</p>
BUG: We call select no matter what the reactor. If the reactor is 
pollreactor, and the fd is &gt; 1024, this will fail. (only occurs on 
broken versions of linux, though).
